# How to Contribute

See the [clap-wide CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).  This will contain `clap_complete` specific notes.

### Scope

`clap_complete` contains the core completion generators, meaning ones
maintained by the clap maintainers that get priority for features and fixes.
Additional, including contributor-maintained generators can also be contributed
to the clap repo and sit alongside `clap_complete` in a `clap_complete_<name>`
crate.
